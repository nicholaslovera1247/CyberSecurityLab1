This is a prototype program that uses a CSV file containing username and password combos to a locked down web sever page for a company. When the user signs on they are created to a menu of pages, and depending on which user it is they can access these pages. The directions are as followed: to sign in, user 1 of 3 usernames: UserA, UserB, UserC. After this you will prompted to put in the correct password. The passwords are as followed: UserA: UserAPassword, UserB: UserBPassword, and UserC: UserCPassword. After you are logged in, please select one of four differenct pages from the menu, trying to select a page that is non-existant will result in a error message and force you to re-enter which page you want to see. UserA has access to all pages, UserB has access to pages 2,3 and 4 and UserC has access to pages 3 and 4 (see menu for which named pages these are). Trying to enter a page that you do not have access to will result in a message stating as such, and forcing you to once again re-enter which page you want. Along with that, if the user tries to enter a username that is not in our database, it will say that they have the wrong username and not give them the option to put in a password, and instead will force them to re-enter their username. The same is for if the user enters the wrong password for the selected username. Once you access a page, a message will printed welcoming you to that specific page, but no over functionality beyond that.
